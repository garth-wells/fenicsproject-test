abstract: We present the Unified Form Language (UFL), which is a domain-specific language
  for representing weak formulations of partial differential equations with a view
  to numerical approximation. Features of UFL include support for variational forms
  and functionals, automatic differentiation of forms and expressions, arbitrary function
  space hierarchies for multifield problems, general differential operators and flexible
  tensor algebra. With these features, UFL has been used to effortlessly express finite
  element methods for complex systems of partial differential equations in near-mathematical
  notation, resulting in compact, intuitive and readable programs. We present in this
  work the language and its construction. An implementation of UFL is freely available
  as an open-source software library. The library generates abstract syntax tree representations
  of variational problems, which are used by other software libraries to generate
  concrete low-level implementations. Some application examples are presented and
  libraries that support UFL are highlighted.
