abstract: We develop a method for generating degree-of-freedom maps for arbitrary order Ciarlet-type finite element spaces for any cell shape. The approach is based on the composition of permutations and transformations by cell sub-entity. Current approaches to generating degree-of-freedom maps for arbitrary order problems typically rely on a consistent orientation of cell entities that permits the definition of a common local coordinate system on shared edges and faces. However, while orientation of a mesh is straightforward for simplex cells and is a local operation, it is not a strictly local operation for quadrilateral cells and, in the case of hexahedral cells, not all meshes are orientable. The permutation and transformation approach is developed for a range of element types, including arbitrary degree Lagrange, serendipity, and divergence- and curl-conforming elements, and for a range of cell shapes. The approach is local and can be applied to cells of any shape, including general polytopes and meshes with mixed cell types. A number of examples are presented and the developed approach has been implemented in open-source libraries.
